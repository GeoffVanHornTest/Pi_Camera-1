## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Bot token leaked in exception logs (#75)** — `telegram_notifier._safe_err()` redacts `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` from exception strings before printing; connection errors (which include the full URL) no longer expose the token in stdout or systemd journal
- **Busy-loop CPU spike on camera error (#70)** — main loop `except` block now sleeps 1s per consecutive error and raises `RuntimeError` after 10, exiting cleanly so systemd can restart and re-initialise hardware
- **Notification cooldown not enforced (#71)** — `send_photo()` checks `_last_photo_sent` against `NOTIFICATION_COOLDOWN_SEC`; rapid re-triggers no longer flood the Telegram chat
- **`_finish_clip()` stale `filepath` parameter (#62)** — parameter removed; path is internal to `camera.stop_recording()` and was unused at the call site
- **Duplicate `_upload_and_notify` closures (#63)** — promoted to a module-level function; the two identical inline closures in the split and finish paths are replaced with a single definition
- **Stale config comments (#67, #72)** — `RESOLUTION`, `VIDEO_BITRATE_BPS`, and `NOTIFICATION_COOLDOWN_SEC` comments updated to reflect current values; `MOTION_COOLDOWN_SEC` and `POST_MOTION_BUFFER_SEC` cross-referenced to clarify their distinct roles
- **Phantom `dropbox` dependency in requirements.txt (#68)** — stale entry removed; `pyproject.toml` is the authoritative dependency list
- **Stale `clips/` entry in `.gitignore` (#73)** — replaced by `00-clips/` (correct directory name since v0.2.0)
- **`strftime` microsecond magic-number slice in `storage.py` (#64)** — `%f` and `[:23]` removed; second-precision timestamps are sufficient given `MOTION_COOLDOWN_SEC = 10`
- **`.env` path in README and docs (#61)** — corrected from `02-scripts/.env` to repo root `.env`; `.env.example` added at repo root with current Telegram + Dropbox keys only
- **`pyproject.toml` version and description stale (#58)** — version bumped to 0.4.2; description updated to reference Telegram + Dropbox
- **`clip-timing.md` stale content** — `MIN_RECORD_SEC` section removed (constant deleted in #43), `PRE_ROLL_SEC` updated 5→8, watchdog narrative corrected (~140s bug note replaced with accurate ~128s), ASCII timing diagram updated

### Fixed (cont.)

- **Day/night detection used Blue channel instead of grayscale (#60)** — `cv2.mean(frame)[0]` returned the Blue channel mean on a BGR frame, not luminance. IR illuminators inflate the Blue channel 5–7× above true brightness, so the system was classifying IR night clips as daytime and applying the wrong threshold. Fixed to `cv2.mean(cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY))[0]`. Field analysis showed 13/19 overnight clips (68%) had the wrong day/night threshold as a result.
- **`MOTION_THRESHOLD_NIGHT` uncalibrated — real motion suppressed (#19)** — threshold was set to 25 000 px² without field data. Overnight dataset analysis (19 clips, midnight–9:45am) showed 50s+ detection gaps on confirmed motion events at T=25 000. Recalibrated to 7 500 to match `MOTION_THRESHOLD_DAY`; field-verified on the same dataset.
- **Stale `MIN_RECORD_SEC` reference in `analyze_clips.py`** — constant was removed in #43; script crashed at the summary print. Fixed to `MAX_RECORD_SEC`.
- **Dropbox-API-Arg built with f-string (#76)** — replaced with `json.dumps()`; filenames containing `"` or `\` no longer produce invalid JSON in the upload header
- **Test frame shape mismatch (#77)** — `test_motion_detector.py` now derives frame dimensions from `config.RESOLUTION` (720p) instead of a hardcoded 1080p constant; tests match the production resolution
- **Cooldown slot consumed when snapshot raises (#78)** — `_currently_recording = True` is now set before `save_snapshot()` so a snapshot failure does not silently consume the `new_event_allowed()` cooldown slot while leaving no clip
- **`on_complete` identity not verified in test (#79)** — `test_finish_clip_calls_stop_recording` now asserts `on_complete is main._upload_and_notify` (identity) instead of `callable(on_complete)` (any callable)
- **Active recording lost on shutdown (#80)** — added module-level `_currently_recording` flag; `_shutdown()` calls `_finish_clip()` before `camera.close()` when a clip is in progress. Follow-up fix: ffmpeg conversion threads changed from `daemon=True` to `daemon=False` so Python's interpreter shutdown waits for `on_complete()` to fire — previously `sys.exit(0)` killed the daemon thread before `_upload_and_notify` could run, silently dropping the upload and Telegram notification on every graceful shutdown with an active clip
- **`list.pop(0)` in centroid history (#81)** — replaced with `collections.deque(maxlen=CENTROID_HISTORY_LEN)`; O(1) rotation, no manual length guard
- **TOCTOU race in `cleanup_old_clips()` (#82)** — `os.remove()` now wrapped in `try/except FileNotFoundError`; a concurrent removal between the `isfile()` check and the `remove()` call no longer raises
- **Invalid package name in `pyproject.toml` (#83)** — `[build-system]` / `hatchling` / `packages = ["02-scripts"]` block removed; replaced with `[tool.uv] package = false` (application project, not a library)
- **Dropbox token refetched on every upload (#84)** — `_get_access_token()` now caches the token with a 4-hour TTL and a 60s safety margin; subsequent uploads within the window reuse the cached token without a network round-trip
- **Shared MOG2 state between tests (#85)** — `test_motion_detector.py` gains an autouse fixture `fresh_motion_detector` that replaces `_bg_subtractor` with a fresh MOG2 instance before each test; ordering-dependent failures eliminated
- **`_log_clip_quality` labels 0% as 'gain' (#86)** — ternary corrected to `"drop" if drop_pct > 0 else ("gain" if drop_pct < 0 else "ok")`
- **Dropbox 150MB limit not enforced (#87)** — `upload()` checks `os.path.getsize()` before calling the API; files over `_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` return `None` immediately with a clear log message
- **griffe warnings under `mkdocs --strict` (#89)** — type annotations added to all public functions in `telegram_notifier.py`, `dropbox_uploader.py`, `motion_detector.py`, and `storage.py`; `mkdocs build --strict` now exits clean
- **RuntimeError from consecutive-error backoff skips `_shutdown()` (#90)** — the `__main__` guard now catches all exceptions (not just `KeyboardInterrupt`), routing fatal errors through `_shutdown()` for clip finalisation and `camera.close()`; `_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS` hoisted to module level for testability
- **Dropbox exceptions expose credentials (#91)** — `_safe_err()` added to `dropbox_uploader.py`; redacts `DROPBOX_APP_KEY`, `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET`, `DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and the cached access token from exception strings, consistent with the pattern established for Telegram in #75
- **Stale "Alert emails" phrase in `clip-timing.md`** — corrected to "Telegram alerts"; Gmail was removed in v0.4.0

### Added

- **Persistent event log (#93)** — `event_log.py` appends one timestamped line per event to `05-logs/pi_camera.log`. Covers `STARTUP`, `SHUTDOWN`, `MOTION`, `SPLIT`, `STOP`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `SNAPSHOT_FAIL`, `TELEGRAM_OK/FAIL/SKIP`, `UPLOAD_OK/FAIL/SKIP`. Rotating handler: 1 MB per file, 5 backups (~5 MB max). Credentials redacted via each module's existing `_safe_err()` before any string reaches the log. Useful for post-hoc troubleshooting when no one is present to watch the terminal.
- **`analyze_brightness_channels.py`** — diagnostic script that samples the first 10 frames of each clip and compares Blue-channel mean, ITU-R BT.601 luminance, and OpenCV grayscale. Reports whether each clip had the correct day/night threshold applied (used to quantify #60 impact).
- **Event log tests** — `test_event_log.py`: 9 tests covering file creation, format, multi-line append, event type padding, and `config.LOG_FILE` location.
- **Day/night brightness regression tests (#95)** — two new tests in `test_motion_detector.py` that construct synthetic IR-like frames (high Blue, low grayscale) and green frames (low Blue, high grayscale) and assert the correct threshold branch is selected. These fail if the grayscale fix is reverted to the Blue-channel bug.
- **Test-session event log isolation (#94)** — `conftest.py` added with a session-scoped `autouse` fixture that redirects `event_log` to a temp path for the entire test run, preventing fake entries from polluting `05-logs/pi_camera.log`.
- **Watchdog split test (#65)** — `test_watchdog_split_calls_split_recording` verifies `camera.split_recording` is called with `on_complete=main._upload_and_notify` when `_split_event` fires
- **`_upload_and_notify` tests (#74)** — two new tests verify the Dropbox link is sent on success and the fallback message is sent on upload failure
- **Token-redaction tests (#75)** — three new tests: `_safe_err` replaces the token, `_safe_err` survives an empty token, and `send_photo` exception does not print the token to stdout
- **Shutdown / recording-continuity tests (#78, #79, #80)** — `test_shutdown_calls_finish_clip_when_recording`, `test_shutdown_skips_finish_clip_when_not_recording`, `test_recording_continues_when_snapshot_raises`
- **Token-cache tests (#84)** — `test_get_access_token_caches_token`, `test_get_access_token_refreshes_when_expired`, `test_upload_returns_none_for_oversized_file`, `test_upload_api_arg_header_is_valid_json`
- **TOCTOU test (#82)** — `test_cleanup_does_not_raise_if_file_deleted_concurrently`
- **`verify_shutdown.py` (#80)** — hardware integration test; starts recording directly, calls `_finish_clip()`, waits for the MP4, and validates it with `ffprobe`. Hardware-verified: 6.2s MP4, 1945 KB
- **Thread map** — swimlane sequence diagram added to MkDocs docs (`thread-map.html`) showing all four concurrent threads and their interactions across a full recording lifecycle
- **Consecutive-error tests (#90)** — `test_main_raises_after_max_consecutive_errors` and `test_consecutive_error_counter_resets_on_success` cover the escalation path and counter-reset behaviour
- **Dropbox credential-redaction tests (#91)** — `test_safe_err_redacts_app_key`, `test_safe_err_redacts_cached_token`, `test_upload_exception_does_not_log_credentials`

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Dead variable `recording_started` (#56)** — left over from the #43 `MIN_RECORD_SEC` cleanup; assigned three times but never read, causing ruff F841 and a broken CI pipeline on trunk

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Dropbox upload race (#54)** — upload now fires via `on_complete` callback after ffmpeg signals success; previously `stop_recording()` returned immediately and the upload thread ran before the MP4 existed
- **Consecutive-clip pre-roll loss (#55)** — `split_recording()` switches `CircularOutput.fileoutput` directly without calling `stop()`, preserving the ring buffer for the next clip; `stop()` drains the deque and would have cleared it
- **Watchdog arms before Telegram send (#35)** — `_arm_watchdog()` moved before `send_photo()` so network latency no longer counts against the MAX_RECORD_SEC budget
- **ffmpeg blocking the detection loop (#34/#42)** — `stop_recording()` now spawns a background thread for ffmpeg conversion; main loop is never blocked
- **Frame drops under load (#53)** — moved to 720p / 2.5 Mbps; field-verified <1% duration error (was ~18% at 1080p / 4 Mbps). ffmpeg runs at `nice -n 10` to yield to the encoder during watchdog splits
- **SIGTERM not handled (#36)** — `signal.SIGTERM` now calls shared `_shutdown()` alongside `KeyboardInterrupt`; `camera.close()` runs on `systemctl stop` / `kill`, preventing hardware lock and crash-restart loops
- **`cv2.imwrite` silent failure (#37)** — `save_snapshot()` now raises `RuntimeError` if `imwrite` returns `False`
- **Telegram API errors silent (#39)** — `send_photo()` and `send_message()` check `response.json()["ok"]` and log a warning on failure
- **`combine_analysis.py` crash on empty join (#40)** — early exit with a clear message when no clips matched both datasets
- **`MIN_RECORD_SEC` dead code (#43)** — constant removed from `config.py`; elif condition in `main.py` simplified to check only `POST_MOTION_BUFFER_SEC`

### Changed

- `RESOLUTION`: 1920×1080 → 1280×720
- `VIDEO_BITRATE_BPS`: 4 000 000 → 2 500 000
- `PRE_ROLL_SEC`: 5 → 8 (more buffer headroom now that frame drops are resolved)
- After each clip conversion, `ffprobe` logs actual vs expected duration so frame-drop regressions are visible in the terminal

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Pre-record ring buffer** — `CircularOutput` runs continuously; every clip automatically includes `PRE_ROLL_SEC = 5s` of footage from before the trigger point (issue #27)
  - Effective pre-roll ~3–5s due to H264 keyframe alignment (2s default iperiod); documented in issue #31
- **Watchdog thread** — `threading.Timer` fires after `MAX_RECORD_SEC` independent of `get_frame()` latency, enforcing the clip cap even if the camera stalls (issue #23)
- `verify_timing.py` — post-run validation script; checks pre-roll, clip duration, and watchdog split behaviour across a recorded dataset
- `run_test.sh` — stop-after-N-clips test helper for controlled field sessions
- MkDocs pages: **Motion Detection & Filtering** and **Clip Timing & Ring Buffer**

### Fixed

- `CircularOutput.fileoutput` rejected `FfmpegOutput` with `RuntimeError: Must pass io.BufferedIOBase` — every trigger silently failed (issue #30); fixed by writing to a `.h264` file handle instead
- CircularOutput flushed without guaranteed SPS/PPS header at stream start — ffmpeg pipe exited immediately, corrupting the MP4 and crashing picamera2's encoder thread, stopping all subsequent detection (issue #33); fixed by writing to a named `.h264` file and converting with `subprocess.run()` after close
- `H264Encoder` default bitrate (~1 Mbps) mismatched assumed 10 Mbps, producing 50s of buffer instead of 5s (issue #31); explicit `VIDEO_BITRATE_BPS = 4_000_000` added to config
- `CircularOutput(buffersize=...)` unit is frames, not bytes — bytes-based calculation produced 2.5 million frames (~23 hours of buffer); corrected to `PRE_ROLL_SEC * FPS = 150` frames (issue #31)
- `stop_recording()` `_proc.wait()` had no timeout — blocked main loop indefinitely during watchdog clip split, preventing second clip from starting (issue #32); resolved by switching to `subprocess.run(..., timeout=30)`

### Changed

- Camera output pipeline: CircularOutput → `.h264` file → `ffmpeg -c:v copy` → `.mp4` (replaces pipe-to-ffmpeg approach)
- `VIDEO_BITRATE_BPS` added to `config.py`; passed to `H264Encoder(bitrate=...)` to avoid picamera2's low default

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Layered motion filter pipeline** — two new filters sit between MOG2 and the recording trigger, dramatically reducing false positives (issues #25, #26)
  - **Blob coherence gate** (`MIN_BLOB_COHERENCE = 0.30`): largest blob must account for ≥ 30% of total foreground pixels — a person scores 0.7–0.95; scattered foliage scores 0.05–0.20
  - **Consecutive-frame gate** (`MIN_CONSECUTIVE_FRAMES = 3`): 3 unbroken frames must pass all blob checks before `detect()` returns `True` — single-frame flickers and brief glints cannot trigger a clip
  - **Centroid history** (`CENTROID_HISTORY_LEN = 10`): centroid of the largest blob tracked over time; infrastructure for a future translation-vs-oscillation discriminator (not yet a hard gate)
  - `reset_motion_state()` added — resets consecutive-frame counter and centroid history between events so the next trigger must earn its count from scratch

### Changed

- `detect()` now returns `(bool, frame)` tuple; callers updated accordingly

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Telegram + Dropbox notification backend** — replaces Gmail SMTP
  - `telegram_notifier.py`: `send_photo()` sends snapshot inline on motion start; `send_message()` sends Dropbox share link when clip upload completes
  - `dropbox_uploader.py`: OAuth refresh token flow; `upload()` returns a shareable URL
  - 9 new tests (`test_telegram_notifier.py`, `test_dropbox_uploader.py`) — total now 38
- **Recording logic overhaul** (fixes R-01 through R-05, issues #14–#18)
  - `motion_last_seen` timestamp replaces blind `time.sleep(POST_MOTION_BUFFER_SEC)` — recording no longer stops on a single no-motion frame
  - `MAX_RECORD_SEC = 120` hard cap with immediate clip split and new recording start
  - `MIN_RECORD_SEC = 15` minimum — clips shorter than this are not saved
  - `MOTION_COOLDOWN_SEC = 10` cooldown gate via `new_event_allowed()` prevents rapid re-triggering
  - Dropbox upload runs in a daemon thread — main detection loop never blocked
  - `camera.start()` called after `stop_recording()` so `get_frame()` does not block indefinitely (issue #16)
- **Day/night threshold auto-switching** — mean frame brightness selects `MOTION_THRESHOLD_DAY` or `MOTION_THRESHOLD_NIGHT` at runtime
- **8-script false trigger diagnostic analysis suite** (issue #22)
  - `analyze_clips.py`, `analyze_reflections.py`, `combine_analysis.py`, `heatmap_analysis.py`, `brightness_trajectory.py`, `duration_stats.py`, `interval_analysis.py`, `cross_analysis.py`
  - Scores clips 0–9 across 8 signals; assigns PERSON / LIKELY_PERSON / LIKELY_FALSE / FALSE_TRIGGER verdicts
- **Phase 3 algorithm plan** documented in `alt_plan.md` — 5-dataset collection strategy, layered filter pipeline design, calibration workflow (issue #28)
- `pi-camera.service` systemd unit — auto-start and crash recovery (`Restart=always`)
  - Currently **disabled** during camera calibration phase; `ExecStart` commented out

### Fixed

- Telegram `ReadTimeout` no longer crashes the recording loop — both `send_photo()` and `send_message()` now catch all network exceptions and log a warning (issue #24)
- `combine_analysis.py` no longer crashes on clips where `duration_sec = "unreadable"` — all numeric fields wrapped in `try/except`

### Changed

- `MOTION_THRESHOLD_DAY` tuned: 500 → 5000 → 10000 → 7500 (current) based on IR noise floor diagnostic and clip gap analysis
- `POST_MOTION_BUFFER_SEC` raised from 5 → 20 (clip data showed 16s stillness gaps for a desk-work subject)
- Google Drive replaced by Dropbox (Drive rejected service account uploads on personal accounts with a 403)
- `notifier.py` (Gmail SMTP) retained as dead code on this branch — not called from `main.py`

### Known issues / open

- Clip timing violations — `MIN_RECORD_SEC` and `MAX_RECORD_SEC` bounds can be breached because timing checks only run when `get_frame()` returns (#23)
- Recording starts after trigger — first few seconds of motion event are lost; pre-record ring buffer needed (#27)
- False trigger rate high in daytime: 238 false clips in 90-minute empty-room window; scoring system misclassified 235/238 as PERSON/LIKELY_PERSON (#22, #25, #26)
- `MOTION_THRESHOLD_NIGHT = 25000` uncalibrated — IR noise floor diagnostic not yet run (#19)

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Motion detection using OpenCV MOG2 background subtraction
- Video recording to timestamped `.mp4` clips via picamera2 + ffmpeg
- Snapshot capture on motion start
- Gmail alert with snapshot attached via SMTP App Password
- Daily clip cleanup (`storage.cleanup_old_clips`) to prevent SD card filling up
- Startup credential validation — clear error if `.env` is incomplete
- Google-style docstrings on all modules
- MkDocs site with Material theme and auto-generated API reference (GitHub Pages)
- pytest unit test suite — 29 tests covering config, storage, motion_detector, notifier
- GitHub Actions CI — lint (ruff) and test on every push and PR
- systemd service unit (`pi-camera.service`) for auto-start and crash recovery
- `uv`-managed dependencies with `pyproject.toml`

### Fixed

- `camera.close()` now calls both `stop()` and `close()` so `/dev/video0` is fully released
- FPS wired up via `controls={"FrameRate": config.FPS}` in camera configuration
- `CLIPS_DIR` anchored to project root using `os.path.abspath(__file__)` — no longer CWD-relative
- `detect()` separated from cooldown logic — recording duration now matches actual motion duration
- Email attachment filename now uses `os.path.basename()` instead of the full filesystem path
- `picamera2` removed from `requirements.txt` — must be installed via `apt`, not pip
